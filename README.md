# metric-learning
Faster implementation of algorithms for metric-learning. As [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_learning#Metric_learning)
describes metric-learning as task of learning distance function over objects. They follow following properties:
* Non-negativity - greater than or equal to 0
* Symmetry 
* Triangle inequality

some of the algorithms for metric-learning include
1. [large-margin nearest neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_margin_nearest_neighbor)
2. [information-theoretic metric learning](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pjain/itml/)
